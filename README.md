# Javascript lab
So, this repo was created to store some personal studies and experiments with JavaScript, so I can find them easily :)

### Other study repos
I also have a specific repo containing all the react courses I've done, and one for node (not so updated because I focused on frontend development \o/)

  - ReactJS studies: https://github.com/luizbaldi/reactjs-study
  - NodeJS studies: https://github.com/luizbaldi/nodejs-study
  - JavaScript tests: https://github.com/luizbaldi/javascript-tdd
