# Basic PWA Guide

So, I created this folder to hold just some studies from [this PWA course](https://www.udemy.com/progressive-web-app-pwa-the-complete-guide/) and have this documentation here in case I need it.

## Steps to create a PWA application

1. Create a manifest.json file (See manifest.json documentation [here](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifest)
2. Link this manifest.json file to the index.html (if not a SPA application, link to all pages)
